Welcome to the Face Recognition Program repository! This project leverages advanced facial recognition algorithms using MAchine learning and OpenCV. The project involved training a model with LBPH algorithm to detect and classify emotions from facial expressions, achieving accurate emotion recognition through real-time video processing.

Project has the following stages:
▶️Define Problem: Set the project goal and identify input/output (e.g., classify emotions from images).
▶️Data Collection & Preprocessing: Gather data, clean it, and split it into training and test sets.
▶️Choose Model: Select an algorithm (e.g., LBPH for emotion detection).
▶️Train Model: Feed training data into the model to learn patterns.
▶️Evaluate: Test on a separate dataset and check accuracy, precision, etc.
▶️Tune & Improve: Adjust parameters and features for better performance.
▶️Deploy: Integrate into a production environment.
▶️Maintain: Update the model as more data becomes available


Key Features:

Advanced Facial Feature Analysis: Utilizes state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect and analyze unique facial features.
Custom Training: Allows users to train the model with their own dataset, enhancing the system's accuracy for specific individuals.
Real-time Face Recognition: Supports live face detection and recognition from camera feeds, providing immediate results.
High Accuracy: Employs robust feature extraction and matching techniques to ensure reliable identification.
Scalable and Extensible: Designed to handle large datasets and can be easily extended with new features or integrated into existing systems.
User-Friendly Interface: Provides a simple command-line interface for training and recognition tasks, making it accessible even to non-experts.
