Welcome to the Face Recognition Program repository! This project leverages advanced facial recognition algorithms using TensorFlow and OpenCV to analyze and identify individuals from input images by comparing their facial features with a trained dataset. The program is designed to provide high accuracy and efficiency, making it suitable for various applications such as security, authentication, and more.


Project has the following stages:

1.Collecting Images with Expressions

2.Detecting Faces in the Images and saving them

3.Training our classifier on the Faces

4.Recognition of expression in new Images


Key Features:

Advanced Facial Feature Analysis: Utilizes state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect and analyze unique facial features.
Custom Training: Allows users to train the model with their own dataset, enhancing the system's accuracy for specific individuals.
Real-time Face Recognition: Supports live face detection and recognition from camera feeds, providing immediate results.
High Accuracy: Employs robust feature extraction and matching techniques to ensure reliable identification.
Scalable and Extensible: Designed to handle large datasets and can be easily extended with new features or integrated into existing systems.
User-Friendly Interface: Provides a simple command-line interface for training and recognition tasks, making it accessible even to non-experts.
